Artificial intelligence continues to be one of the biggest future growth sectors for investors to get in front of. Many sectors are going to see a big benefit from artificial intelligence growth. Thanks to recent developments, one of the stocks that could be a big winner in the artificial intelligence boom has resurfaced on my radar and is now my favorite investment for this coming shift to AI. Nuance Communications (NUAN) will benefit from its position in artificial intelligence solutions for healthcare, automotive, and enterprise solutions. With that said, the stock is a strong buy here on recent weakness and trading near 52-week lows.
Nuance Communications is a name that immediately pops up as familiar to most investors. Many investors and people know the company’s technology as it has powered their car’s entertainment systems, listened to them place orders for Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), and even once powered Apple’s (OTC:APPL) popular Siri service. Today, we look at why Nuance Communications has a bright future as a leader in virtual assistants in healthcare, enterprise, and automotive. The company has already worked with large companies and continues to be one of the most sought after for the artificial intelligence segment. I continue to be surprised to not see Nuance Communications listed in all of the artificial intelligence stocks to buy lists.
Healthcare is the Biggest Catalyst
Nuance shares got a slight lift this past week after the company unveiled its new AI Marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging. Nuance shared details in a press release and also unveiled the technology at the Radiological Society of North America Conference, currently taking place in Chicago.
